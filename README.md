📈 Stock & Index Prediction and Analysis
A data science project that uses historical stock and index data to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and predictive modeling using machine learning techniques.

🧠 Features
✅ Download and preprocess historical stock/index data (e.g., from Yahoo Finance or NSE)

📊 Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and correlation studies

📈 Visualize trends, volatility, moving averages, RSI, MACD, and more

🤖 Build machine learning models to predict stock/index prices (LSTM, ARIMA, XGBoost)

📉 Evaluate model performance with RMSE, MAE, and R²

🛠️ Interactive dashboard using Streamlit or Plotly Dash (Optional)
